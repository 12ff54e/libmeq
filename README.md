# **M**agnetic **EQ**uilibrium library

Given poloidal magnetic flux $\psi_{p}$ (analytic or numeric), calculate its Boozer coordinate representation.

2D field can be represented as BSpline or Zernike series, controlled by macro `MEQ_ZERNIKE_SERIES_`

# Note

This repository is separated from [mct](https://github.com/12ff54e/mct), which depends this library to construct magneitc equlibrium.
